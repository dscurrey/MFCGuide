# MFC

## Overview

MFC encapsulates the Win32 API (Application Programming Interface), a C interface to Windows OS services. It provides C++ classes which speed up Win32 application development.

It does this by encapsulating some key features of Win32 development to make them simpler and easier to use, as well as by hiding some of the more low-level aspects of programming for Windows.
